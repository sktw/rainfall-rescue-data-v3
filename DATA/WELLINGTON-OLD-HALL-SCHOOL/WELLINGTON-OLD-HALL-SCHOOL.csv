NGR is Old Hall at the correct altitude and relationship to Church.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Current Old Hall School is further north but is too low and also a modern building that was not a school in the 19th century.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Old Hall School was originally in Old Hall in the 1840, there are schools on old OS maps 100 yards north, which may be the location.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Dr J E Cranage, the observer, founded Old Hall School and lived there",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
