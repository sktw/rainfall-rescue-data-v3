Medical Officer Portland Prison - The Grove,,,,,,,,,,
This gauge was in the very early days of the prison,,,,,,,,,,
Assume officers quarters existed so NGR near them at lower altitude to match elevation,,,,,,,,,,
1855 Jan Note says 'I believe that the observer lost the entry and filled in the total for Jan 1856 from The Breakwater' ,,,,,,,,,,
The Breakwater gauge did not start until 1856 but matches Jan 1855 value of 3.56,,,,,,,,,,
