NGR is Copse Hill. Stated altitude is 70 ft. too high but  stated altitude is within 100m of NGR used.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Relationships to church and station are broadly consistent with both NGRs,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The same NGR has been used as for the 1920s record but probable that the gauges are in different positions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
